# relis-statistical-analysis-dsl

## üîç Overview

This repository extends the statistical analysis capabilities of *[ReLiS](https://github.com/geodes-sms/relis)* : a tool for conducting systematic reviews, develop by the [GEODES](https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/) software engineering group at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/).

It provides to the users a comprehensive Python environment to performs the statistical analysis of their *ReLiS* SR project classification data. 

It uses a *Domain Specific Modeling* approach (DSM), including a *Domain specific language* (DSL), to generate statistical analysis models from the *SR* project classification data.
These models are then used to automatically generate the executable artifacts used in the Python environment.
