# relis-clissification-satistics

### Overview

This repository extends the basic statistical classification capabilities of *ReLiS*: a tool for conducting systematic reviews, develop by the [GEODES](https://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/) software engineering group at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/).

It provides to the users a *Domain specific language* (DSL) to create custom analytical protocol models based on their *ReLiS* project classification metadata.
These protocol models are then used to automatically generate Python code. When executed, this code produces analytical reports detailing the classification data of the relis project.
